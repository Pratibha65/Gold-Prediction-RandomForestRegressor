# Gold-Prediction-RandomForestRegressor

• The objective of your project is to predict gold prices (GLD) using a Random Forest Regressor model based on various economic indicators. 
• Preprocessed the data by removing the date column and performing exploratory data analysis, including visualizing correlations and distributions.
• Selected the features (SPX, USO, SLV, EUR/USD) and target variable (GLD) for modeling.
• Split the data into training and testing sets and trained a Random Forest Regressor model. The model achieved high accuracy on both the training and testing data, indicating it is performing well in predicting gold prices based on the given features.
